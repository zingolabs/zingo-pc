 * Which route stays selected when a refresh replaces the quote.
 *
 * Route ids are minted per quote, so nothing survives a refresh by id. What
 * the user chose was a provider, and that is what is carried across.
 *
 * Where they chose nothing the selection was ours, so it follows the new
 * optimum: holding our own earlier pick left the panel showing a route that
 * had stopped being the best one.
 *
 * A provider they did pick and that stopped quoting is the one case with no
 * answer of ours to give. Selecting another on their behalf would hand the
 * money to a counterparty they never chose, with the panel looking like their
 * own choice, so the selection is dropped and the caller is told which
 * provider went, to say so and to wait for a fresh pick.
