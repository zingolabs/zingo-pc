 * can still hold an all-zero placeholder until the next poller tick rewrites
 * it, and a placeholder renders a row that copies nothing and links nowhere.
 *
 * De-duplicated because a swap has fewer transactions than it has names for
 * them. On an outbound swap the transaction this wallet broadcast is the one
 * the provider observes, so `broadcast.txId` and `observedDepositTxHash` hold
 * the same hash — and it was listed twice, under "Deposit" and under
 * "Broadcast", with a copy button each, as though there were two things to
 * look at. React noticed before anyone did: keyed on the hash, the two rows
 * collided.
 *
 * The first name wins, and the order below is what that means: what a hash is
 * to the swap before what this wallet did to produce it.
