 * surfaces need the same answers — the post-commit slip in `SwapExecute` and
 * the detail view a user comes back to after closing it — and because these
 * are the decisions that cost real money when they are wrong. As pure
 * functions they can be tested without mounting anything.
 *

 *      with the memo as `data` calldata. The only shape that carries address,

 *   2. **No memo (NEAR Intents / Flashnet)** — a memo-less payment URI that
 *      still pre-fills the exact amount, which is what those providers are
 *      strict about. Native gas assets only; a token would make the wallet
 *      send the gas token instead.
 *   3. **No memo and no URI scheme for the chain** — the bare deposit address,
 *      so the user can at least scan it and type the amount from the row below.
 *
 * Returns `null` when a memo exists but no URI can carry it: a UTXO BIP-21 URI
 * silently drops the OP_RETURN, and a QR that looks complete while omitting
 * the one field the provider routes on is worse than no QR at all. The caller
 * falls back to the manual rows, which spell the memo out.
