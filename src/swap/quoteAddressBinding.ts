/**
 * Which address a quote carries, and whether a quote carries the current one.

 * SwapKit prices a swap without reading the counterparty address, so quotes
 * can stream while the user is still typing one. The route it mints is a
 * different matter: the route is bound to the addresses it was quoted with,
 * and a provider that builds the route around the destination rather than
 * around a deposit memo will not commit one quoted blank — it refuses the
 * route id, not the swap call, so substituting the real address at commit
 * time does not rescue it.
 *
 * Named here rather than written inline on the screen because the two halves
 * have to agree: the address a quote goes out with, and the test for whether
 * the quote on screen went out with the one the user is looking at now.
