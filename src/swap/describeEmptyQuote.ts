/**
 * Why a quote came back with no routes, in the user's terms.
 *
 * SwapKit answers 200 with an empty `routes[]` and a `providerErrors[]`
 * explaining each refusal, so this never travels the error path and the reason
 * would otherwise be dropped on the floor. The common case by far is an amount
 * under the provider minimums, and the response states the minimum outright —
 * telling the user "no route is available" when the truth is "add a bit more"
 * sends them looking for a fault that is not there.
 *
 * The largest minimum is the one quoted: a smaller one belongs to a provider
 * that would still refuse, so it would be an amount that does not fix
 * anything. When the providers disagree on why, or say nothing useful, this
 * falls back to the generic sentence rather than inventing a cause.
 *
 * Otherwise the sentence is followed by each provider's own reason, one line
 * each, from `unavailable`. A bare "no route" had users changing amounts
 * that were never the problem, or giving up on a pair one network away from
 * working: NEAR's temporary $1,000 minimum on BSC and a Flashnet that cannot
 * price the pair this minute read identically to it.
