 * Persistent store for `SwapRecord`s.
 *
 * Backed by `encryptedStorage`, which hands the value to the main process for
 * `safeStorage` to encrypt against the OS keychain. Records carry
 * swap-tracking metadata rather than seeds or keys, so the encryption is
 * precautionary.
 *
 * Storage layout — one key per wallet, holding a single JSON array:
 *   - One `EncryptedStorage` entry under `storageKeyFor(fingerprint)` holding
 *     the whole `SwapRecord[]`. Writes are full-array overwrites.
 *
 * Why one key (vs one per record + an index):
 *   - The number of records per wallet is small (tens, maybe low hundreds over
 *     a wallet's lifetime). Loading the whole array into memory is fine and
 *     keeps the storage layout obvious.
 *   - A separate index file would need to be kept in sync with per-record
 *     entries; a single key eliminates that class of bug entirely.
 *
 * Concurrency — promise-chain mutex:
 *   - All public methods enqueue onto a single static promise chain so that
 *     read-modify-write operations cannot interleave. This rules out the
 *     classic race where two concurrent `upsert` calls both read `[A, B]`,
 *     each mutate locally, and the later `writeAll` clobbers the earlier
 *     one's change. Inside a queued operation we call the private `_readRaw`
 *     / `_writeRaw` helpers which bypass the queue to avoid self-deadlock.
 *   - Reads go through the queue too so the caller sees read-after-write
 *     consistency relative to in-flight mutations. The cost is a few ms of
 *     extra wait on the (rare) overlap; the benefit is one less class of
 *     subtle bugs to reason about.
 *   - Failures in one queued operation do not stop the chain. The original
 *     caller observes the rejection on the promise we returned; the queue
 *     itself stores the swallowed-error variant so subsequent enqueues run.
 *
 * No partial recovery: if `EncryptedStorage` returns malformed JSON we treat
 * the store as empty rather than throwing — the activity list would still
 * show the unaffected records on next swap. Storage corruption of swap
 * tracking is not a wallet-fatal event.
