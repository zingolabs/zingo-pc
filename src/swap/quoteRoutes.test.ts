/**
 * `quote()` projects SwapKit's routes into what the screen reads. Two of those
 * numbers are load-bearing: the fee total in the sell asset feeds the largest
 * amount the user is offered and the guard that refuses a commit, and the fee
 * total in the receive asset is the headline the user judges the route by.
 *
 * The arithmetic exists because SwapKit denominates fees inconsistently. Maya
 * quotes most of them in the destination asset, NEAR quotes almost everything
 * in the source asset, and a screen that showed only one side would print a
 * zero over fees the user is really paying.
