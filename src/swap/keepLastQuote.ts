/**
 * The routes on screen that a refresh did not bring back, but that still
 * stand.
 *
 * A route is a price the provider committed to until its expiry: Flashnet's
 * are good for about twelve minutes. Flashnet also answers
 * `estimate_unavailable` on and off from one quote to the next, so a refresh
 * without it said nothing about the route the user had just picked, and
 * replacing that route with the other provider's (or with "no route") took
 * away a price that was still on offer.
 *
 * So a shown route carries over into the refreshed list while:
 *   - the refresh asked the same question (a changed amount, asset, address or
 *     slippage deserves its own answer, whatever it is);
 *   - the provider did not answer this time (a fresh route replaces the old
 *     one from the same provider);
 *   - it has at least MIN_REMAINING_VALIDITY_MS of its own validity left, time
 *     to review and commit; a route without an expiry carries over only while
 *     the last fresh answer is younger than STALE_QUOTE_GRACE_MS.
