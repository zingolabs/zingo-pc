 * User-facing labels for the SwapKit provider enum.
 *
 * Two variants intentionally:
 *
 *   - `providerShortLabel` is the compact form used in dense surfaces (the
 *     swap-screen summary row, the route picker rows). Matches the mockup
 *     wording (`"MayaChain"`, `"THORChain"`, `"NEAR"`).
 *   - `providerLongLabel` is the verbose form used in the post-commit deposit
 *     instructions and the review summary, where there is room for the
 *     descriptive suffix (`"Mayachain Streaming"`, etc.) and the user benefits
 *     from knowing the exact routing variant.
 *
 * Falls back to the raw enum value as a last resort so we never render
 * `undefined` if SwapKit adds a provider we have not seen yet.
