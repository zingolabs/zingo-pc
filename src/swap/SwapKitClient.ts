/**
 * Thin typed wrapper over SwapKit's REST v3 API.
 *
 * Responsibilities (kept narrow on purpose):
 *   - Hold the API key and base URL.
 *   - Build requests for `/v3/quote`, `/v3/swap`, and `/track`.
 *   - Apply per-operation timeouts via `AbortController`.
 *   - Wrap transport failures in `SwapKitNetworkError` and non-2xx responses in
 *     `SwapKitHttpError` — never return raw fetch errors.
 *
 * Non-responsibilities (live elsewhere):
 *   - Building deposit instructions from a `/v3/swap` response — that is the
 *     job of each `ProviderExecutor`, since the response shape is provider-
 *     specific.
 *   - Polling cadence and dedupe — `SwapPoller` owns that.
 *   - Persisting records — `SwapStore` owns that.
 *
 * The client refuses to construct on anything other than mainnet: SwapKit has
 * no testnet routing for any of the providers we use, so the only way to
 * exercise this code is mainnet. Defensive guard against UI gating regressions.
 *
 * Timeouts: quote/swap have a longer budget because the provider sometimes
 * needs to allocate a deposit address (NEAR Intents) or rotate a vault
 * (Mayachain). Track is the hot path called on every poller tick, so the
 * shorter timeout protects against a slow `/track` blocking the poller.
 *
 * URL encoding: query params are encoded with `URLSearchParams`; the SwapKit
 * `asset` strings contain `.` and `-` which are URL-safe, but contracts that
 * include `=` or `?` would not be — `URLSearchParams` handles all of these.
