/**
 * Why asking for a quote failed, in the user's terms.
 *
 * "No route" never comes through here: `SwapService.quote` turns it into an
 * empty quote, which `describeEmptyQuote` explains. What is left is a request
 * that was refused or never answered, and almost all of it is said well
 * enough by the error itself.
 *
 * The exception is the size limit on the API key. SwapKit answers a quote
 * above it with 403 `swapSizeExceeded` and "Reach out to SwapKit team to
 * request higher limits", which is advice for the developer and reads to the
 * user as a wallet that has been locked out. The answer does not say what the
 * limit is, so neither does this.
