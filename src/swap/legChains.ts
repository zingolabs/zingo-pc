/**
 * The chain a `/track` leg runs on, from the id SwapKit names it by.
 *
 * Legs carry a lowercase chain id ("zcash", "near", "solana"), while asset
 * ids and the explorer table use the short symbol ("ZEC", "NEAR", "SOL"). The
 * two are not a case change apart exactly where it matters: "solana" upper-
 * cased is not "SOL", and "zcash" is not "ZEC".
 *
 * Only ids seen on real responses are listed. An unknown id still gets a
 * usable fallback, the id itself, so a new chain shows its hash under its own
 * name rather than disappearing; it gets an explorer link once it is added.
