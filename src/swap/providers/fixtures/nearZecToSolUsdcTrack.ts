/**
 * A completed NEAR Intents swap of ZEC into USDC on Solana, as `/track`
 * returned it on mainnet on 2026-09-12.
 *
 * The shape is the real one: the chain ids, the leg kinds and their order,
 * the statuses, and which hashes are present. Every hash and address is
 * replaced. The response ties a Zcash deposit to a Solana wallet, and this
 * file is public; nothing a test asserts depends on the real values.
 *
 * Three legs, and the middle one is what the detail screen used to miss: the
 * `execute_intents` call on NEAR, which is where the swap itself happens and
 * the only link SwapKit's own explorer gives for it.
