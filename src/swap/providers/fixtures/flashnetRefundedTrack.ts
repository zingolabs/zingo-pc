/**
 * A refunded Flashnet swap of ZEC into USDC on Solana, as `/track` returned it
 * on mainnet on 2026-09-12.
 *
 * The shape is the real one: the deposit leg on Zcash, the Spark swap leg that
 * never landed, and the refund leg back on Zcash, last. Every hash, address
 * and order id is replaced; this file is public.
 *
 * Nothing in it is on Solana. With the delivery taken positionally from the
 * last leg, the refund hash was stored as the destination and opened on a
 * Solana explorer, and it hid the Refund row that should have shown it.
