/**
 * The deposit shape shared by the THORChain-family providers: pay a rotating
 * inbound vault address, and say which swap it is in a memo carried on the
 * source-chain transaction.
 *
 * Mayachain is a THORChain fork and both answer `/v3/swap` the same way, so
 * the extraction is one piece of code rather than two that have to be kept in
 * step. What differs between them — the provider identity and the persisted
 * `providerData` — stays with each executor.
 *
 * The probing below is not defensive padding. SwapKit's response shape has
 * drifted across provider revisions, and the memo has been observed at
 * `tx.memo`, top-level `memo`, `meta.memo`, and inside
 * `transient.providerDetails.memo`. A deposit paid to the right vault with no
 * memo is a deposit the provider cannot attribute, so reading it is not
 * optional.
