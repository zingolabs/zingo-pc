/**
 * Wire-level shape of SwapKit `/v3/quote` response.
 *
 * Only the fields we actively consume are typed. The full response is much
 * larger and contains forward-compatible provider-specific blobs; rather than
 * over-model what we do not read, we keep an `unknown`-typed catch-all so the
 * raw payload can still be inspected by debug screens or future executors.
 *
 * The response contains an array of `routes` (one per provider that could
 * fulfil the swap). The route chooser projects each entry to `RouteOptionType`
 * before showing it to the user.
 *
 * Field naming mirrors SwapKit (lowerCamelCase). Do not rename without a server
 * change.
