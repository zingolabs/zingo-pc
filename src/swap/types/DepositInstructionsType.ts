/**
 * Normalised "what does the user need to send" returned by a provider executor.
 *
 * The SwapKit `/v3/swap` response shape varies wildly per provider — some return
 * a memo + vault address (Maya, THORChain), some return only a unique deposit
 * address (NEAR Intents), some return both plus a channel id (Chainflip).
 *
 * Each provider's executor `extractDepositInstructions(swapKitSwapResponse)`
 * collapses that into this uniform shape, which is what:
 *   - the outbound flow feeds into zingolib's `propose_send` (depositAddress as
 *     the recipient, amount as the send amount, optional `memoBytes` plumbed
 *     through the OP_RETURN parameter we added in librustzcash);
 *   - the inbound flow renders on screen via the deposit-instructions card.
 *
 * `providerData` is the persisted per-provider variant. Keeping it inside the
 * deposit-instructions return value lets `SwapService` write it straight onto
 * the `SwapRecord` without re-querying the provider executor.
 *
 * `amountHumanDecimal` is the exact amount the user is expected to deposit,
 * formatted in the source asset's display units (e.g. `"0.05"` for 0.05 ZEC).
 * Providers occasionally round, so we keep the executor-canonical value here
 * rather than re-deriving from the quote.

   * declared `sourceAddress`. A deshield names no transparent sender, so it
   * fails that check: ord_01a09310 (2026-09-11), paid straight out of the
   * shielded pool, carries `errorCode: deposit_source_mismatch` in the
   * Flashnet order record, and ord_01a095f2, paid from the declared
   * address, carries none.
   *
   * NEAR also mints per order but checks no sender, and a NEAR swap paid
   * from the shielded pool completed, so the addressing scheme is not what
   * sets the two apart. Maya and THORChain share a vault and read a memo.
