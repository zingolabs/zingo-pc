/**
 * What a route delivers compared with what the user sends, both valued at the
 * market prices SwapKit quotes alongside it.
 *
 * SwapKit reports this per route as `totalSlippageBps`, and the name misleads:
 * it is neither the slippage tolerance nor a minimum. Checked against live
 * quotes on 2026-09-12, it equals `expectedBuyAmount` at the buy price over
 * `sellAmount` at the sell price, minus one, to every decimal it carries, and
 * it did not move when the requested tolerance went from 1% to 3%. It is the
 * all-in cost of the route: fees, spread and price impact together.
 *
 * That makes it the one figure that compares routes on price. In the quote it
 * was checked against, Flashnet delivered half a point less than NEAR and was
 * about six times faster, a trade the screen could not show before.
 *
 * Put in words rather than as a signed percentage. A negative next to a fee
 * reads as a second charge to add to it, and a negative cost is a double
 * negative; "below market value, fees included" says both what it is and that
 * the fee is already inside it.
