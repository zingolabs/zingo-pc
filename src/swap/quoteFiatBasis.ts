/**
 * The USD unit prices for a quote's two assets, snapshotted at quote time.
 *
 * Persisted on the record so the history shows what the swap was worth when it
 * ran, not what those assets are worth today. Today's price on a months-old
 * swap says nothing about the swap.
 *
 * SwapKit publishes these per route, under `route.meta.assets[]`, rather than
 * at the top of the response (verified against `api.swapkit.dev/v3/quote`,
 * 2026-06-28). The top level is still read as a fallback in case that ever
 * flattens, and prices are collected across every route because a single route
 * can carry a partial list.
 *
 * A missing price becomes 0 rather than an error: the record must persist
 * either way, and the surfaces that show a fiat figure hide it at 0 instead of
 * printing a a value they cannot stand behind.
