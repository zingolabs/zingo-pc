 * the vault with the memo attached. Two transactions, two fees.
 *
 * Maya and THORChain always carry one — it is how they know which swap a
 * deposit belongs to, and their refund destination is read from the
 * transparent origin the second transaction exposes. Flashnet carries one only
 * when SwapKit supplies it, which is why this asks what the provider *can* do
 * rather than what a particular quote did: the reserve is computed before the
 * route is committed, and the memo arrives with the commitment. NEAR Intents
 * never sends one and stays at a single transaction.
 *
 * Erring towards two is the safe direction, for the reason `zecNetworkFeeReserve`
 * gives.

 * until the route is committed — by which point the user has already been
 * shown a maximum and told whether they can afford it. So the screen reserves
 * a figure instead.
 *
 * It errs high deliberately. Reserving a few thousand zatoshis too many costs
 * the user a swap amount a hair below what they could have sent; reserving too
 * few walks them into a send that fails for want of funds, after they have
 * already committed the route at the provider. The two mistakes are not the
 * same size.
 *

 * that funds the transparent address, and the transparent spend that pays the
