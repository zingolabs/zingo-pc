/**
 * Identifies the SwapKit provider that routes a swap.
 *
 * Source: `meta.provider` field in SwapKit `/v3/quote` and `/track` responses,
 * and `providers[0]` in route options. These literal strings are required by
 * SwapKit's REST API and must not be renamed without a SwapKit-side change.
 *
 * Adding a new provider:
 *   1. Add the literal here (must match what SwapKit returns).
 *   2. Add a `ProviderExecutor` implementation under `app/swap/providers/`.
 *   3. Register it in `ProviderRegistry`.
 *   No other code paths should hard-code provider identifiers.
